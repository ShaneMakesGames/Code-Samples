# **Script Descriptions**
Scripts from my Senior Project, Recursion Error :

## [**Cybernetics & Status Effects**](https://github.com/ShaneMakesGames/Code-Samples/tree/main/Recursion%20Error/Cybernetics%20%26%20Status%20Effects)
- Cybernetics are a gameplay mechanic that adds additional effects or behavior to certain actions such as dashing or attacking. One cybernetic applies a status effect which deals damage over time to any enemies you attack. 

## [**Enemy Healthbar UI**](https://github.com/ShaneMakesGames/Code-Samples/tree/main/Recursion%20Error/Enemy%20Healthbar%20UI)
- These scripts control the enemy healthbars and damage numbers that appear when an enemy takes damage.
